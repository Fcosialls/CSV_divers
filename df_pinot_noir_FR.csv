129803,France,"Soft, ripe and rich, this is very easy on the palate. The wine does have good depth of flavor from the rounded black cherry flavors, the fruit almost sweet in its openness. It is already delicious.",En Chevret,89,65.0,Burgundy,Volnay,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Louis Latour 2013 En Chevret  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,Louis Latour, 2013 En Chevret  (Volnay),2013,Mid
129804,France,"Concentrated, with dark tannins to go with the ripe fruit. There is a tough edge to the wine, although it is more accessible than some Nuits-Saint-Georges at this stage.",Les Damodes,89,115.0,Burgundy,Nuits-St.-Georges,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Louis Latour 2013 Les Damodes  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,Louis Latour, 2013 Les Damodes  (Nuits-St-Georges),2013,Mid

129917,France,"A powerful, chunky wine, packed with solid tannins that promise good aging. It has a sense of drama in its spice, dark tannins and spacious fruit.

129922,France,"A blend from several premier cru vineyards in Pommard, here is a wine that exhibits just the right firm but dusty tannins of the appellation. But because it is 2009, the natural exuberance of the fruit is also there, lively red berries under the dry structure. It needs some aging, but already the richness is there, along with a smoky aftertaste.",Premier Cru,91,66.0,Burgundy,Pommard,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Bouchard Père & Fils 2009 Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père & Fils, 2009 Premier Cru  (Pommard),2009,Good
